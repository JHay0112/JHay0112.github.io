In the near past I updated my website from a design I had produced around 2020. That version of my
website contained a section I eventually settled on calling my "Project Blog". All of the articles
on this version of the website come from the Project Blog. 

With this version of the website I decided to make a distinction between documentation of on-going 
projects and articles that show off the result of a project or a smaller project in its entirety. As
my spare time is relatively limited, completing this transition is slow going. I hope to have the
project section completed by early 2024. In the meantime I recommend looking through the articles 
section of my website. Thank you for your patience. - Jordan
