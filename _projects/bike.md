I am currently in the process of progressively upgrading my bicycle. My intentions are to develop an 
integrated lighting system before expanding upon the architecture of the system to support further 
electronic systems. This requires carefully planning the lighting system to ensure that its 
architecture supports the addition of further electrical systems. 

A Git repository for this project with design files and documentation may be found 
[here](https://github.com/JHay0112/bike). At the time of writing, the repository contains a set of
[preliminary requirements](https://github.com/JHay0112/bike/blob/requirements-rev0/docs/lighting-requirements.md)
and [an early model of the bike frame](https://github.com/JHay0112/bike/blob/requirements-rev0/mech/frame.FCStd).
