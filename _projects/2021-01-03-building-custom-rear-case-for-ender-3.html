Recently I acquired a modded Ender 3 with the SKR 1.4 controller and automatic bed levelling. The custom case the previous owner printed I found to be insuffecient as when the heated bed reached its endstop it would stress the wires as they got near their maximum length. I knew I couldn't keep this design for long so I began designing my own rear mounted solution.

<div><h4 style="text-align: left;">My criteria:</h4><div><ul style="text-align: left;"><li>Rear mounted.</li><li>Room for SKR 1.4 + Raspberry Pi.</li><li>The USB cable going from the Pi to the SKR 1.4 should be contained within the case.</li><li>The Pi's Ethernet + Power + one of the USB ports should be accessible from the outside.</li><li>Ideally I should be able to pick up the entire printer without the case falling off.</li></ul><h2 style="text-align: left;"></h2></div><div><div style="text-align: right;"><a href="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-PdcgM4XvR58/X5YafwltieI/AAAAAAAAENw/Zy-OWDSuKiw8enTFDGrF4egwcMlwFvLzQCLcBGAsYHQ/ezgif.com-gif-maker.gif" style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;"><img data-original-height="538" data-original-width="737" height="234" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-PdcgM4XvR58/X5YafwltieI/AAAAAAAAENw/Zy-OWDSuKiw8enTFDGrF4egwcMlwFvLzQCLcBGAsYHQ/w320-h234/ezgif.com-gif-maker.gif" width="320" /></a></div>I used Fusion 360 to develop the 3D model of the case. This was my first use of Fusion 360 to design something I intended to print.</div><div><br /></div><div>After a first failed print I added an extension to the front which gave the cable between the Pi and SKR 1.4 more room in order for it to reach between the two.</div><div><br /></div><div>I noticed some defficiences with the first design. The case did not account for the other ports on the Pi, as such it could not fit into the designated space and I had to cut some holes to make it work while I revised the design. The slots for the screws that will go into the metal extrusions also needed expanded by a few mm, and the space between mounts for the SKR 1.4 board were also too wide.</div><div><br /></div><div>I also decided that once printed I would find a cover for the holes under each board. I presume I added them in to save filament but I'm not entirely sure. They wouldn't be the only exposed PCB on the Ender 3 but I think it is best to cover them if I can.</div><div><br /></div><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="float: left; margin-right: 1em; text-align: left;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><img border="0" height="253" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-RvGMlm9HNxQ/X5e2KwSF3UI/AAAAAAAAEPk/dJCIr0yAL9IfXAq7Q4Jz1SklXnwlgW7PQCLcBGAsYHQ/w337-h253/1603778088193990-0.png" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" width="337" /></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">Second Iteration Installed (Without Lid)</td></tr></tbody></table><div><a href="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-RvGMlm9HNxQ/X5e2KwSF3UI/AAAAAAAAEPk/dJCIr0yAL9IfXAq7Q4Jz1SklXnwlgW7PQCLcBGAsYHQ/s1600/1603778088193990-0.png" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;">       </a>The second print solved the warping issue and all of the other size issues.
