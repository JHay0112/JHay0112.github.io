Wow! This project is really old huh. In fact this project is so old it actually has a significant
amount of text included in it. Hopefully more than 300 characters if I'm really lucky. It would be
perfect for testing out the truncation on project cards. I'm starting to think that the first time
I probably didn't put enough text in here to see proper truncation which messed up my expectations
of what a truncated post would look like. That is a real problem for me since it is quite important
to know just how long the text is going to be to make sure that the height of the project cards is
correct.
