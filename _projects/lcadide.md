Have you ever wanted to symbolically solve simple linear circuits but there hasn't been a convenient
and accessible GUI for you to use? Over the summer of 2022-2023 part of my work as a research
assistant involved developing a solution for this problem called 
<a href="https://lcadide.jordanhay.com" target="_blank">lcadide</a> - a web-based symbolic circuit
solver based on the <a href="https://github.com/mph-/lcapy" target="_blank">lcapy Python package</a>
developed by Professor Michael Hayes.
