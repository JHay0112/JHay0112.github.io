<p>jmath is a set of mathematical tools I have developed in order to understand the maths behind them (and some computer science concepts) a little bit better. jmath has been developed as a package for Python and can be installed in used in the same way as any Python package such as matplotlib.<br /></p><p>At the time of publishing jmath is capable of the following:</p>

<ul style="text-align: left;"><li>Simple Vector Maths (jmath.linearalgebra)<br /></li><li>Calculations with uncertainties (jmath.uncertainties)</li><li>Some limited discrete graph application (jmath.discrete) <br /></li></ul><p>The following are still in development and are largely considered:</p><ul style="text-align: left;"><li>Further maths involving graphs (jmath.discrete)</li><li>Circuits based upon discrete graphs (jmath.physics.circuits)</li><li>Mechanical simulations (jmath.physics.mechanics)</li><li>Fractions/rational maths (jmath.fractions)</li><li>Lines and planes based on vector maths (jmath.linearalgebra)</li></ul><p>These are subject to change and up to date information can be found on&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/JHay0112/jmath">Github</a>. <br /></p><p>jmath is published on <a href="https://github.com/JHay0112/jmath" target="_blank">Github</a> and <a href="https://pypi.org/project/jmath/" target="_blank">Python Package Index</a> (meaning it can be installed with pip), however I only intend for it to be a personal project for the time being. Documentation can be found at <a href="https://jmath.jordanhay.com/">https://jmath.jordanhay.com/</a></p><p><b>Update (03/11/2021)</b>: Added documentation link. <br /></p>
