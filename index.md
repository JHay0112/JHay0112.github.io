<section id="introduction">
    <p>
        Kia ora, my name is Jordan Hay. I am a PhD student at the University of Canterbury. My 
        interests include electronics, radio communications, programming, and photography.
        I graduated at the end of 2024 with a BE(Hons.) specialising in Computer Engineering with a 
        minor in Communications and Network Engineering with First Class Honours. 
    </p>
    <p>
        I believe that good engineering is only done when the needs of the project stakeholders are 
        well understood, and appropriate technologies are used to solve the problem. I have been
        described as a competent and passionate engineer who solves problems with well thought-out
        solutions.
    </p>
    <p>
        I have applied my engineering skills across multiple industries&mdash;aerospace, power, and 
        telecommunications. I bring a multi-disciplinary approach with my understanding of analogue
        electronics, embedded systems, and application programming. I like projects that have an
        emphasis on the end-user experience and delivering reliable results. My role has often 
        involved developing custom hardware and software solutions, and I know that my work
        continues to give value to the companies I have worked for to this day.
