        Hi, my name is Jordan Hay. I grew up in Timaru and now study at the University of Canterbury (UC)
        in Christchurch. I am interested in electronics, radio communications, operating systems, 
        cycling, Geocaching, and photography.

        I am in my third year of study towards a Bachelor of Engineering (with honours) specialising 
        in Computer Engineering and aim to complete a minor of Communications and Network Engineering.
        I also tutor COSC122: Introduction to Computer Science. This involves weekly computer lab 
        sessions where I help students learn foundational computer science skills alongside Python 
        programming.

        Professionally I have worked as a Digital Services Assistant and a Trainee Radio Technician at 
        Alpine Energy Ltd. and Ashley Communications Ltd. respectively. I have a solid foundation in
        practical electronics and information technologies through my experience in these roles.
