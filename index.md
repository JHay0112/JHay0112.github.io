        Kia ora, my name is Jordan Hay. I am a PhD student at the University of Canterbury. My 
        interests include electronics, radio communications, programming, and photography.
    </p>
    <p>
        I recently graduated with a BE(Hons.) specialising in Computer Engineering with a minor of 
        Communications and Network Engineering with First Class Honours. Throughout my degree I had
        the oppurtunity to develop electronics and software

    <p>
        Professionaly, I have a solid foundation in electronics and information technologies. 
        Recently, I've worked both as an Electronics Engineering Intern at Dawn Aerospace and as a 
        Digital Services Assistant at Alpine Energy. Both roles gave me the opportunity to develop
        hardware and software systems that continue to play an important part to this day.
