        Hi, my name is Jordan Hay. I grew up in Timaru and now study at the University of 
        Canterbury. My interests include in electronics, radio communications, operating systems, 
        programming, and photography. This is my personal website, where I have a little information
        about myself and write the occasional <a href="/articles">article</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
        I recently completed my fourth year of study towards a Bachelor of Engineering (with 
        honours) specialising in Computer Engineering with a minor of Communications and Network 
        Engineering.

        Professionaly, I have a solid foundation in electronics and information technologies. 
        Recently, I've worked both as an Electronics Engineering Intern at Dawn Aerospace and as a 
        Digital Services Assistant at Alpine Energy. Both roles gave me the oppurtunity to develop
        hardware and software that continue to play an important part to this day. 
    </p>
    <p>
        I occasionally write <a href="/articles">articles</a> about my projects and I put most 
        things on my <a href="https://github.com/JHay0112" target="_blank">GitHub</a>. Sometimes 
        things also appear on my 
        <a href="https://www.instagram.com/jordanhayphotos/" target="_blank">Instagram</a>,
        <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCGUPz4yMrsQyk95Z8ZwtMog" target="_blank">YouTube</a>,
        or <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/JHay0112/" target="_blank">LinkedIn</a>.
