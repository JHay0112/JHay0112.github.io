The website you're looking at (at least at the time of publishing) is the ninth version of my 
website[^versioning]. If you're willing to permit me the indulgence, I'd like to reflect on how this
website has got here since it's first appearance in 2017. ([Click here if you don't wish to
permit me the indulgence.](/))

Sadly, this website wasn't remotely mobile-friendly, and I liked playing with JavaScript perhaps a
little bit too much. You might notice the website even tells you the current time and date (why?)

Version 2 didn't depart from the bold colour scheme. It made some minor improvements and added a
development blog. (I recall agonising over whether to call it a blog or a log, in retrospect I would
have called it a log.) In fact, the only reason that I now distinguish between this version and 
version 1 is because that very development blog does.

Version 3 refined the design features laid down by versions 1 and 2 with a minimal landing page.
I'm less fond of simple landing pages these days[^stopusinglandingpages] but there is something that
I still quite like about this look.

    Punchbowl".</figcaption>

Version 4 simply tweaked the landing page and isn't terribly interesting so we'll skip straight to
version 5. In Version 5 I added more information to the landing page, I particularly enjoyed the 
"skill bars" at the time.

Version 5 is notable since I began to use Bootstrap as my first foray into mobile-friendly design (a
practice I have now since stopped in favour of my own mobile-friendly CSS.)

I wish I could skip version 6. (Though I like the background!)

Version 7 followed a very similar theme with a slightly more up-beat feel.

Version 8 was a signifigant overhaul compared to most of the previous versions. I wanted to increase
the cohesive feel of the website and use it as a real show piece. This was a level of ambition above
everything that came before (except perhaps the first few iterations.)

I was particularly proud of version 8, and it hung around for quite a while. However, the novelty of
the flashy animations slowly but surely wore off. I stripped back the animations and attempted to
move the website to a much more lightweight feel, but I never really felt entirely satisfied with
the layout. After much delay I decided something had to give, thus version 9 was born.

Version 9 (the current version at the time of writing) is designed to feel simple, and ideally like
little more than a piece of paper with some writing and images on it. Those of you on a desktop 
computer have large margins on the left and right to keep a paper-like ratio, and the navigation
links are static and simply underlined at the top of the page. Only the landing page has a header
image, other pages are focused only on their content. I will admit that I have still indulged in a
little JavaScript to change the header image on the landing page with each visit, however that is
the extent of the dynamic content (unless you happen to press a specific key on the home page...)

More changes to come no doubt...


[^versioning]: This does really depend upon how you define versions. For this article's purposes I'm
    defining versions as major changes to the style and layout of the website. I haven't formally
    defined versions in my version control system and have tended to continuously tweak and refine
    my website without noting what "version" it is - this isn't terribly good habit, and I ought to
    change it.

[^stopusinglandingpages]: Landing pages require an extra click for the user to find out anything
    about the website. I prefer the first page to explain itself, and then the user has a better
    idea of why they might click into subsequent pages. This isn't a hard and fast rule though!
    There are always exceptions, and this is just what I think is best for my website in particular.
