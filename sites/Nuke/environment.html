            <h1>Environmental/Biological Impact of Nuclear Weapons</h1><br>
            
            <p>When a nuclear weapons explodes, it releases something called ionizing radiation. Ionizing radiation is radiation or electrons emitted in waves as part of the electromagnetic spectrum with lots of energy (Wavelengths above 760 THz) so that when it interacts with atoms it can remove tightly bound electrons from the atom causing the atom to be charged or ionized. Only high frequency/high energy radiation can be ionising (Alpha particles, Beta particles, X-rays, Gamma rays, and Neutrons). Ionizing radiation can cause changes to the DNA or deter cell replication especially if exposed to it for a long time or in large amounts. Ionizing radiation can also affect large molecules such as proteins in the cells and change the function and metabolism of the cells.</p>
