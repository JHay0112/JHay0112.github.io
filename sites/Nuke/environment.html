            <p>When a nuclear weapons explodes, it releases something called ionizing radiation. Ionizing radiation is radiation or electrons emitted in waves as part of the electromagnetic spectrum with lots of energy (Wavelengths above 760 THz) so that when it interacts with atoms it can remove tightly bound electrons from the atom causing the atom to be charged or ionized. Only high frequency/high energy radiation can be ionizing (Alpha particles, Beta particles, X-rays, Gamma rays, and Neutrons). Neutrons, Gamma rays and Alpha particles are released when a nuclear weapons is used. Ionizing radiation can cause changes to the DNA or deter cell replication especially if exposed to it for a long time or in large amounts. Ionizing radiation can also affect large molecules such as proteins in the cells and change the function and metabolism of the cells.</p><br>
            
            <p>The best examples of people being affected by ionizing radiation are, Hiroshima, Nagasaki, and Chernobyl. In al three examples we see the effects on humans from radiation exposure, early on, radiation sickness and then later in life or a generation on, thyroid cancer. In Nagasaki and Hiroshima we also see burns and other injury and death due to the explosion itself. In Chernobyl people were burnt from the resulting uranium fire.</p><br>
            
            <p>Radiation sickness is caused by exposure to high amounts of radiation, the radiation damages and destroys cells in the body the most vulnerable cells are the cells lining of your intestinal tract, including your stomach, and the blood cell-producing cells of bone marrow. The symptoms and severity of radiation sickness are affected by the amount radiation absorbed by the body and the parts of the body exposed to the radiation. Most symptoms include, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, headache, fever, disorientation, dizziness, weakness, fatigue, hair loss, infections, poor wound healing and low blood pressure.</p>
